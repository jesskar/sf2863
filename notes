6: 

Assume that we start in State i,
we know that all states communicate with each other: for k=1,..,4 p_ik is not zero
for each element in row i of the matrix Q, extract the elements and use as averages when sampling form exp.
This yields for random variables, corresponding to rates of transition from state i to state k

Choose to jump to state k which fulfills min(X_k). 

Repeat until convergence according to (7).

Also, record the total time of the iterations, as well as the total number of visits in each state.

Assume that we start in State i
we know that all states communicate with each other: for k=1,..,4 p_ik is not zero
for each element (not i) in row i of the matrix Q, extract the elements and use as averages when sampling from exp.
This yields three random variables, corresponding to time to transition from state i to state k

Choose to jump to state k which fulfills min(X_k).
